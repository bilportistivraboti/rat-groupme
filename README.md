# Rat-GroupME

The implant is the rat.ps1 and will be ran every X minutes, POSTing to the 
heroku python app asking for what commands to be ran. After running these 
commands, output is sent to the attackers in their set groupme chat. 

app.py, runtime.txt, requirements.txt, and commands.txt are all necessary on the 
herouo app-side.
